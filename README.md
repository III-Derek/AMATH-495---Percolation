# Learning Percolation

For this project, we use CNNs to predict several metrics of percolation.

Our main programs are located at:

* Main ipynb script for machine learning: `src/ml.ipnb`
* Matlab bw code image generation and max cluster size: `src/data_generation/perco_sim_bw.m`
* Matlab rbg code image generation and max cluster size: `src/data_generation/perco_sim_rgb.m`
* Julia code for computing percolation probability: `src/data_generation/v2/main_final.jl`
