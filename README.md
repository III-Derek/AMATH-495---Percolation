# Learning Percolation

for this project, we use CNNs to predict several metrics of percolation.

Our main programs are located at 

* Main ipynb script for machine learnign: `src/ml.ipnb`
* Matlab bw code image generation and max cluster size: `src/data_generation/perco_sim_bw.m`
* Matlab rbg code image generation and max cluster size: `src/data_generation/perco_sim_rgb.m`
* Julia code for computing percolation probability: `src/data_generatoin/v2`
